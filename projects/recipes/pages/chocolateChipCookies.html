  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup (2 sticks or 226g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup (220g) packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups (about 340g) chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 cup (optional) chopped nuts (such as walnuts or pecans)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as it can result in dense cookies.</li>
    <li>Fold in the chocolate chips and nuts (if using), distributing them evenly throughout the dough.</li>
    <li>Scoop rounded tablespoons or use a cookie scoop to drop portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are slightly soft. Adjust the baking time according to your preference for chewy or crispy cookies.</li>
    <li>Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!</p>
