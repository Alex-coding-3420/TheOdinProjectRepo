    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>32 oz (900g) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li> tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Stir until the crumbs are evenly coated with butter.</li>
        <li>Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, creating an even layer. Use the back of a spoon or the bottom of a glass to firmly press the crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add the sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until well combined and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li>Add the sour cream and flour to the mixture, and beat until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheesecake batter over the prepared crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula to create an even surface.</li>
        <li>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour to gradually cool down. This helps prevent cracking.</li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to set.</li>
        <li>Once chilled and set, remove the sides of the springform pan. If desired, add your preferred toppings such as fresh berries or chocolate sauce.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve your delicious homemade cheesecake. Enjoy!</li>
